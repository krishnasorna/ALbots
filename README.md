This is an evolving Ludobot that seeks the nearest blocks of cubes and tries to run into them to destroy it. The evolution process is to take steps away from the screen to the left of its x axis and will train itself to run into those placed cubes. It will try to run into those grey blocks as it evolves to move faster and stronger to the left away from the screen. Thus, that is the fitness function and its ability to run towards the blocks and destroy them.
